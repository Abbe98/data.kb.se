==========

Tools and templates to generate a catalog of file based datasets typically hosted on an Apache server. Files are stored in a folder together with an index file in yaml. A script collects the index files and generates a catalog index page in html. The catalog index page contains a machine readable representation in [RDFa](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-rdfa/).
